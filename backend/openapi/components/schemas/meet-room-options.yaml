    autoDeletionDate:
        type: [number, 'null']
        example: 1900000000000
        description: >
            The date and time when the room will be deleted (must be one hour in the future or more) represented in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

            After this date, the room will be automatically deleted and no new participants can join.

            If this value is set and the date has already passed, the room is marked for deletion but will only be removed after the last
            participant leaves ("graceful deletion").

            If this value is not defined, the room will exist indefinitely until manually deleted.

        example: 'room'
        description: >
            A prefix to be used for the room ID. The room ID will be generated by concatenating this prefix with an unique identifier.
            The maximum length of the room ID is 50 characters.
