        description: >
            The date and time when the room will be deleted, represented in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

            After this date, the room will be automatically deleted and no new participants can join.

            If this value is set, the room is marked for deletion but will only be removed after the last
              participant leaves ("graceful deletion").

            If this value is not defined, the room will exist indefinitely until manually deleted.
