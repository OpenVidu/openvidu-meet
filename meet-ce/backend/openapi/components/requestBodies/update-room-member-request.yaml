                        The base role that defines the default permissions for this member. Options are:
                        - moderator: By default, has full permissions to manage the room and meeting.
                        - speaker: By default, has permissions to publish audio and video streams.

                        Individual permissions can be overridden through the 'customPermissions' object.
                customPermissions:
                    type: object
                    additionalProperties:
                        type: boolean
                    example:
                        canShareScreen: false
                        canRecord: true

                        An optional object containing custom permission overrides for the base role.
                        Only include the permissions you want to override from the base role defaults.
                        Each property should be a permission name (e.g., 'canRecord', 'canShareScreen') with a boolean value.

                        For the complete list of all available permissions, see the full permissions schema:
