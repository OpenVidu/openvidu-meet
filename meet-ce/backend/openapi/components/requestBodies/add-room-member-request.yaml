                        The unique username for OpenVidu Meet users. This field should be provided when adding an internal Meet user as a member.

                        If provided:
                        - The member will be associated with the Meet user account.
                        - The 'name' field will be ignored and automatically set based on the Meet user's profile name.

                        If omitted, the member will be treated as an external user and 'name' must be provided.

                        Note: You must provide either 'username' or 'name', but not both are required.
                name:
                    type: string
                    maxLength: 50
                    example: 'Alice Smith'

                        The display name for the participant when joining the meeting with this member access.

                        This field is required only when adding an external user (when 'username' is not provided).
                        If 'username' is provided, this field will be ignored and the name will be set from the Meet user's profile.

                        Note: You must provide either 'username' or 'name', but not both are required.
                baseRole:

                        - moderator

                        The base role that defines the default permissions for this member. Options are:

                        canShareScreen: false
                        canRecord: true
