name: X-ExtraFields
in: header
description: >
    Specifies which extra fields of the `room` object to include fully in the response.

    <br/><br/>

    By default, certain large or nested properties of the `room` object (like `config`) are excluded
    to optimize payload size and reduce network bandwidth.

    <br/><br/>

    Use this header to include the full data of these properties in the response,
    avoiding the need for a subsequent GET request.

    <br/><br/>

    Provide a comma-separated list of `room` property names to include.

    <br/><br/>

    > **Note:** Extra fields specified here will be included even if not specified in the `X-Fields` header.

    <br/><br/>

    This header is supported on all room operations. For GET and DELETE operations,
    it can be combined with the `extraFields` query parameter. When both are provided,
    values are merged (union of unique fields).
