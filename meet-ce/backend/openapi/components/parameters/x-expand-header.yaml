description: >
    Specifies which complex properties to include fully expanded in the response.

    By default, certain large or nested properties (like `config`) are replaced with expandable stubs
    to optimize payload size and reduce network bandwidth.

    Use this header to include the full data of these properties in the creation response,
    avoiding the need for a subsequent GET request.

    Provide a comma-separated list of property names to expand.
