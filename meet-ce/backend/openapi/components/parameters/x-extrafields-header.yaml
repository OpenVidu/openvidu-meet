name: X-ExtraFields
in: header
description: >
    Specifies which extra fields to include fully in the response.

    By default, certain large or nested properties (like `config`) are excluded
    to optimize payload size and reduce network bandwidth.

    Use this header to include the full data of these properties in the creation response,
    avoiding the need for a subsequent GET request.

    Provide a comma-separated list of property names to include.

    Note: Extra fields specified here will be included even if not specified in the `X-Fields` header.
