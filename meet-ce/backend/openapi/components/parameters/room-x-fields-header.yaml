    Provide a comma-separated list of `room` property names to filter the response payload.

    This header allows you to optimize API responses by requesting only the data you need
    from the `room` object, reducing bandwidth usage and improving performance.

    <br/><br/>
    This header is supported on all room operations. For GET and DELETE operations,
    it can be combined with the `fields` query parameter. When both are provided,
    values are merged (union of unique fields).
