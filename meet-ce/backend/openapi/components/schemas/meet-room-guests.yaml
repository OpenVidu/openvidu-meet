    Configuration for guest access to the room. Guests are participants who join without being registered members.

    The guests object contains two roles:
    - moderator: Has full permissions to manage the room and meeting by default.
    - speaker: Has permissions to publish audio and video streams by default.

    Each role has an access URL and a set of default permissions that will be applied to all guests joining with that role.
